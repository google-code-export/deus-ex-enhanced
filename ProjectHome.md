# Latest Version: 2.0.0 #
Primarily focusing on higher resolution textures with bump and height maps, and generally making the game look better on modern widescreen lcd panels.


For those who do not meet the DirectX 10 requirement, version 1.3 will work quite well using a modified OpenGL renderer found here: http://www.cwdohnal.com/utglr/.

## Future Roadmap ##

Note:  I haven't done anything with this for a few months, since I stopped playing. I'm sure I'll get around to it someday... But, everything I had planned after 2.0 is just eyecandy anyways.

  * 2.1.x : High-res GUI for all HUD elements, and last few remaining fonts will be updated (Some menus, computer screens)
  * 2.2.x : High-res GUI for persona screens (inventory, etc)
  * 2.3.x : Add additional textures to the sides for widescreen display in persona screen

## Change Notes ##
3/04/2011: Version 2.0.0 released.
  * High resolution anti-aliased fonts, which fixes dialogue cut-off problems encountered when using normal GUI scaling on high resolution monitors
  * Fixed the significant weapon accuracy inflation cheat normally experienced when using mods that disable the normal GUI scaling.
  * Fixed weapon accuracy for various aspect ratio screens (although I guessed on 16:9)
  * (Bugfix): fixed a corrupted string that caused a problem with the email received from Dan the janitor in Mission #3 (my bad)
3/04/2011: Version 1.3 released.
  * Runs without DX10 operating system/hardware
2/20/2011: Version 1.0.1 released.
  * Improved sniper scope and binocular view graphics
    1. higher resolution lens effect
    1. higher resolution graphical overlays
  * Reduced binocular viewable area by 25%, but added image enhancement to center box.  It's still like 50% larger than Vanilla.
  * Fixed minor bug regarding sight reticule being off by one pixel (was present in Vanilla).
2/19/2011: Version 1.00 released.
  * Improved sniper scope and binocular views.  Doubled visible area.
  * Added finer grain control of in-game brightness settings.
