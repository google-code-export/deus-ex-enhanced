I. About Deus Ex Enhanced


Deus Ex Enhanced is a personal project of mine to increase the replayability of Deus Ex on modern hardware.  

This includes widescreen lcd panels, accompanied by modern high performance CPUs and GPUs.

There are some really great Deus Ex mods out there, but none really address the game's dated GUI, which was
heavily tuned for a resolution of 640x480 (and it shows).

The biggest problem I had when trying to playing DX on my modern PC is that the normal GUI scaling cut off

dialogue.  Sure, this is solved by OTP's GUI Fix... However, it introduces its own set of problems:

	1) It makes game text painful to read.
	2) Your accuracy is artificially increases significantly.


This mod aims to fix those issues, and more. 


II. Why Deus Ex?


Why not?  It was (and still is) a very popular game title.  Deus Ex, given its age, has a lot of room for improvement... 
which is good for me, as someone looking to improve the game.

Another interesting point is that Deus Ex, when you get right down to it, is just a huge mod running ontop of the
Unreal game engine.  As such, the code size is manageable... and so, in a short time, I'll be able to become very intimate with
its code. ;)


III. Installation


Important Note: Between each step, it's common sense to verify that your game still works properly (and backup any files before 
you overwrite them).  You've been warned.

I will assume you just somehow managed to find a copy of Deus Ex, and have downloaded my mod (since you're reading this).
So, here are the broad strokes:

Part 1: (Install requirements)

	1) Install Deus Ex
	2) Install the latest official patch*
	3) Install a mod that disables normal GUI scaling*&
	4) Install Shifter 1.84*&

Part 2:
	1) Copy the files included in this archive into your deus ex folder.  For me, that would be: 

		e:\deus ex\

	Your drive letter is probably different.  You'll know you got it right if your operating system asks
	you if you want to overwrite the existing files.	

	2) Check out my recommended mods list, and/or moddb.com for additional mods.
	
*: See external links 
&: Steps 3 and 4 are interchangeable


IV. Uninstallation


I don't know why you would, but all you have to do is overwrite the 3 files included in this archive with your backup copies.  

You did make backups, right?!

Ok... 

Let's say you didn't make backups... 

Here's the steps to remove Deus Ex Enhanced:

	1) Re-install Shifter 1.84
	2) Overwrite your current infoportraits.utx file with the one available in the downloads section at this mod's 
	   Google Code project page.  Your file will be in the folder:
	
		../deus ex/textures/

	To uninstall Shifter, you'll have to read its readme file.

	Consider leaving comments at moddb.com as to why you decided to uninstal Deus Ex Enhanced (or why you enjoy it!), 
	because it could help me improve it.


V. Keep Up To Date


This mod is changing fast, and I'm constantly adding new features and fixing any bugs I find.  So, stay up to date with
the latest version!  

New version will be available at Moddb.com, and all versions will always be available at my Google Code project site.

Major version changes (i.e. v1.x.x to v2.x.x) will always have increased system requirements, so
make sure your system can handle it before installing.
